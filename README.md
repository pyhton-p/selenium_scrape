# Project Summary ‚Äì Member Info Scraper and Auto Emailer

## üìå Project Overview

This script was developed to **automatically collect member information** from a specific website, organize the data into an Excel file, and **send it via email once the process is complete**. The entire process is automated to save time and reduce manual work.

## ‚úÖ What This Script Does

1. **Scrapes Data from a Website**  
   - It opens a webpage that lists member profiles.
   - From each profile, it collects:
     - Full name
     - Email address
     - Phone number
     - City and country
     - Organization and job title
     - Event-related content (link and date)

2. **Stores Data in Excel File**  
   - All collected information is saved into an Excel file.
   - The file is automatically updated during the process.
   - File name: `member_details.xlsx`

3. **Sends Email with Excel File**  
   - Once the data collection is complete, the script automatically sends the Excel file to a predefined email address.
   - This step uses Gmail (or another email service) to deliver the file without manual involvement.

4. **Runs with a Single Command or Automatically**  
   - You can run the script manually.
   - Or, it can be integrated into a scheduler or system that runs automatically on a regular basis.
